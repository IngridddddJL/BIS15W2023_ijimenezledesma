## Instructions
Answer the following questions in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.



## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  

**You need a bachelors degree in data science or a computer related career. 

2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 

**I am comfortable using R, more specifically I can take a data set, analyze it, clean it up and then make it easier to understand for those that aren't familiar with code. 

3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)

**I am currently interested n becoming a foresic scientist and my new R skills would support me in this career because it would allow me to collect my own data and know how to use it to represent/show certain things through R coding, instead of having others do it. 

4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?

**I think the most difficult part is having to remember all of the different commands and codes. More specifically I found it different to go from the more simpler  stuff to the harder/more complicated and still remember the basics. The most rewarding was finally understanding the stuff we were learning and applying it to my own work (I felt really cool).


5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.

**I wish I had taken more notes from the beginning and looked into the resources available.

6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?

**I once heard Dr. Ledford say that we would be able to add sparkles/glitter to our graphs and he never taught us how to do it, so if that is possible I would've liked to learn that. Besides that I really enjoyed learning how to make the app and would've liked to do more stuff like that. 

7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to persue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?

**I think data science is a very interesting field but, I don't see myself voluntarily pursuing anymore computer science skills just because it just wasn't my cup of tea. I am interested on more of the front end aspect of coding (what the viewer sees) so, I might look into that if anything.

8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?

 **SUPER important, I almost cried every time  I did the homework because it was a bit overwhelming to me in the beginnings. But thankfully, my partners where always there to guide me through it and help me understand where I went wrong. 

9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.
